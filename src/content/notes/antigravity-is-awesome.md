I'm genuinely impressed by Antigravity. Building this site with it has been eye-opening.

The thing that really got me is how you can queue up multiple requests and it will execute them in parallel. It's like having a team of AI assistants working on different parts of the project at once.

It helped me set up the Astro project, implement that interactive particle background (which has a fun easter egg if you wave your mouse around enough to connect 50+ nodes), and generally just... build things faster without the usual friction.
