description: Update the README with the latest project information and changes
---

This workflow guides the agent to update the `README.md` file with the latest project changes, features, and scripts.

1.  **Analyze Changes**:
    *   Check for newly created files, scripts, or documentation (e.g., `push_image.ps1`, `docker_push.md`).
    *   Identify any changes in deployment processes or tech stack.

2.  **Update README**:
    *   Read the current `README.md`.
    *   Add or update sections to reflect new capabilities.
    *   Specifically, ensuring "Deployment" or "Scripts" sections cover new tools like `push_image.ps1`.
    *   Ensure any new "Features" are listed.

3.  **Verify**:
    *   Ensure the `README.md` is accurate and formatted correctly.
